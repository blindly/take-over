            <h3>Memo</h3>
            <p>Welcome. You are the new regional CFO. You're here to turn the company around. We want you to make the
                company profitable.</p>
            <p>Work as much as you can. Once you start buying companies, they will begin generating profits. Our goal is
                total world takeover.</p>
            <p>Your work will be saved frequently, so plan accordingly. </p>
            <p>Some "fees" or "donations" will be necessary and substracted automatically. However, the more you work, the less frequent these happen.</p>
            <p>Note that you are in charge of our Africa division. If you prove yourself, you'll be able to invest in more world markets.</p>
            <p>Remember. If you fail, the company will fail. We are counting on you.</p>
